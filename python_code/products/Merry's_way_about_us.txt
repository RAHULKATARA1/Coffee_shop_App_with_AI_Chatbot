Welcome to The Cozy Bean, your neighborhood coffee shop located in Krishana Nagar , Mathura . At The Cozy Bean, we believe that coffee is more than just a drink—it’s an experience, a moment of joy, and a way to connect with others.

Our Story
Founded in 2018, The Cozy Bean started as a small family-owned café with one mission: to share the love of quality, ethically-sourced coffee with our community.

Our passion for travel and coffee led me on a journey across South of India , where we handpicked partnerships with small farms and cooperatives. We ensure that every cup we brew tells a story of dedication and care, from farm to table. Our beans are roasted in-house to bring out unique flavors that reflect the regions where they were grown.

In addition to offering a cozy place to enjoy coffee in our café, we proudly deliver to all over the Mathura City. Whether you’re at home, in the office, or enjoying a day at  temples , we bring your favorite coffee right to your door. Just a click away, our delivery service ensures that you never miss your daily cup, no matter where you are.

Our menu offers something for everyone, from our signature espresso blends to refreshing cold brews, artisanal teas, and fresh-baked goods sourced from local bakeries. We also cater to a variety of dietary needs with a range of plant-based milk options and gluten-free snacks.
